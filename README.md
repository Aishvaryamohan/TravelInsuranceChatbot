# Travel Insurance Chatbot

The Automated Travel Insurance Chatbot is designed to engage customers in a dynamic conversation, which will enable customers with a good level of interaction with the Travel insurance system. 
This is automated to choose multiple travel plans as like in webpage, based on the interactive and personalized customer engagement. It helps customers to choose the right plan for them. 
We create specific travel insurance plans for students, senior citizens and for a family or a group of people. 
All plans offer combined insurance and services, such as coverage for accident and illness medical expenses, transportation expenses associated with medical evacuation and in event of accidental death or dismemberment and  medical assistance services. 
Depending on the plan selected, other features and options are available.
