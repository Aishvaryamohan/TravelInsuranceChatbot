RELATED WORK

The first Chatbot Eliza, was built in 1966 which was accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa or messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or Wechat. 
Chatbots are available in many fields to increase the customer interaction and to offer many additional ways for them.
The top companies such as Reliance, Bajaj Allianz, HDFC ERGO has many travel insurance plans.
The existing system gets connected to the customer service agent.

PROPOSED APPROACH

In order to overcome the problem in the existing system, we have built the Automated Travel Insurance Chatbot which provides information about the available policies in the system.
The Chatbot will give immediate answers offering 24/7 support and can simultaneously have conversations with thousands of people.
This is the easier approach for the users to answer all their queries.
It almost covers all the emergency and medical expenses.

The Automated Travel Insurance Chatbot will take the query from the user and will give the appropriate answer to the user query. The user will just have to visit the web page of the Chatbot and interact with the bot to get the answers to their query.

METHODOLOGY

The chatbot is built using Dialog flow. It is a Google service that runs on the Google Cloud Platform. It also incorporates Google's machine learning expertise and products such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. 
We can connect with users on your website, mobile app, the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and other popular platforms and devices. 
By using the integration option in the Dialog flow the chatbot can be connected to many applications. 
While logging into the website, the email id and password are stored in the database so that if the user has an existing insurance plan it can be identified.
After logging into the website by providing valid email id and password, the user will be connected to the next page where there will be many travel insurance plans according to their category and their uses. 
The user can interact with the chatbot and find a suitable plan according to their need. The response time to the queries of the user will depend upon the internet speed of the user. 
If the user has a good internet connection, he/she will get the answers to their queries in the 3-5 second. If the user has a bad internet connection, this process will take some time, which is estimated to be 4 seconds approximately. 
But even in the worst case, the response time will not exceed 15 seconds.
